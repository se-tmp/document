        \setlength{\itemindent}{0.5cm}
            \item The application could control actions manually initiated by user. This events contain turning devices on or off, adjusting settings, and triggering automation sequences. It maintains logs of these control actions, capturing the user responsible, the devices affected, and the specific actions taken. Additionally, it tracks the timestamp of each control action for reference.\\
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

    \item {\large{Routine Managemant}}\\
    \begin{enumerate}[label*={\arabic*.}]
        \item {\large{Trigger Settings}}\\
            \begin{enumerate}[label*={\alph*.},ref=\theenumi.\arabic*]
            \setlength{\itemindent}{0.5cm}
                \item {\large{Sound Trigger}}\\
                \begin{enumerate}[label*={\arabic*.},ref=\theenumi.\arabic*]
                \setlength{\itemindent}{0.5cm}
                    \item Users can set conditions to trigger accessories or scenes based on sound intensity. For example, when a loud noise is detected at home, a message can be sent to the user. Or trigger a camera to capture what's going on. For speakers that can recognize voice, the response action can be completed according to the user's voice instructions.\\
                \end{enumerate}
                
                \item {\large{Sensor Trigger}}\\
                \begin{enumerate}[label*={\arabic*.},ref=\theenumi.\arabic*]
                \setlength{\itemindent}{0.5cm}
                    \item Response functions are triggered based on various sensors such as smoke alarms, flood alarms, motion sensor, air monitoring sensor. For example, if smoke is detected at home, a message can be sent to the user. Another example, The air purifier can be triggered automatically when the air quality declines.\\
                \end{enumerate}
                
                \item {\large{Time Trigger}}\\
                \begin{enumerate}[label*={\arabic*.},ref=\theenumi.\arabic*]
                \setlength{\itemindent}{0.5cm}
                    \item Accessories or scenes can be triggered based on a fixed time of day, certain days, or based on sunrise and sunset. For example, turn on the curtains and music at 6 a.m. every morning, or turn off all lights 15 minutes after sunset.\\
                \end{enumerate}
                
                \item {\large{Posture Recognition Trigger}}\\
                \begin{enumerate}[label*={\arabic*.},ref=\theenumi.\arabic*]
                \setlength{\itemindent}{0.5cm}
                    \item By obtaining images or videos through a camera and using OpenPose to recognize body posture, it is also possible to recognize body movements and trigger different functions based on different movements.\\
                \end{enumerate}

                \item {\large{Position Trigger}}\\
                \begin{enumerate}[label*={\arabic*.},ref=\theenumi.\arabic*]
                \setlength{\itemindent}{0.5cm}
                    \item The user's location can be determined based on the location information of the user's mobile phone, and corresponding functions can be triggered based on the user's location. For example, when the user returns home, they automatically turn on the lights and automatically start the air conditioner.\\
            \end{enumerate}
    
        \end{enumerate}
        \item {\large{Behavior Settings}}\\

        \begin{enumerate}[label*={\arabic*.},ref=\theenumi.\arabic*]
        \setlength{\itemindent}{0.5cm}
            \item The user must set the action to trigger through a specific trigger Action through gesture recognition in opencv above. For example, you have to be able to set the behavior of turning on the light, controlling the brightness, and how long the time interval is,\\

            \item More than one action light can be set with a single trigger, it must support collaboration between multiple devices, it must be user-generated, voice, sensor, time, and posture recognition should edit and delete the routine required for each trigger, and each user should be able to set the name of the routine and enable/disable the routine.\\
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

    \item {\large{Application Settings}}\\
    \begin{enumerate}[label*={\arabic*.},ref=\theenumi.\arabic*]
    \setlength{\itemindent}{0.5cm}
        \item App Settings section, the user can set up the app. We need to implement this to initialize the setup data.\\

        \item A push alarm on/off button must be implemented to determine whether or not to receive an alarm that alerts you when the routine is started by a particular trigger.\\

        \item Each time each user logs in, backup and restore routines should be implemented without the need to create a new routine.\\

        \item The logout button should be implemented to enable account changes and a refresh function that allows users to set their own username.\\
